There you should first store all your training data (photos that will teach your model what to detect). 
Also here you should later store .xml files that you will get from your labeling.

After you collect all your data and label it you have to divide those files into training(bigger) and testing(smaller) groups and put them in respective folders.
!!!Remember to never separate pair of photo and .xml file (example: apple1.jpg and apple1.xml must be in same group)!!!
